# Cucumber-login-automation
This BDD automation script employs Cucumber for testing the login functionality of a web application, written in Gherkin syntax. Gherkin enables collaboration between non-technical stakeholders and developers, expressing test scenarios in plain language.

The 'login.feature' file outlines scenarios with Given-When-Then steps for clear behavior understanding. Implemented in Python, step definitions interpret Gherkin steps, executing actions such as interacting with login fields, clicking buttons, and verifying expected outcomes.

Cucumber in Python promotes reusable step definitions, maintaining a clear separation between scenarios and automation code. The framework generates easily readable reports, facilitating collaborative testing efforts.

This foundational login script, written in Python, provides a basis for expanding test coverage and integrating additional features, ensuring the reliability and robustness of the web application's login functionality.
